# BORED CHORD 4D

This is a program born of the question: what would a 3D Bowditch curve look like? 

Bowditch curves, also known as Lissajous curves show how two waveforms interact when they are plotted as the X,Y coordinates on a grid.

In the pre-electronic era, these shapes could be revealed by bouncing a projected beam of light at mirrors mounted to vibrating tuning forks. 
The vibration of the first fork, now modulating the beam, would be bounced to a second mirror on a tuning fork with a different pitch. 
If those two pitches had a simple rational relationahip based on the harmonic series, Simple elegant curves like those below could be seen.
The auditory sensation of consonance (as opposed to dissonance) that all humans experience is a physical reaction to hearing simple fractions.
Humans evolved to be able to hear those simple integer relationships that we now know to be a part of the harmonic series and which forms
the foundation of musical tuning systems from all around the world. Below are 4 of the simplest two-note relationships that can exist.

So it stands to reason that since any chord (i.e. simultaneous sounding of multiple tones) can be expressed with ratios just like two notes can,
more dimensions could be added to the Bowditch curve beyond X & Y. A triad could be represented as a 3D curve, and as I soon realized, it doesn't
need to stop there. Musicians are not limited to simple triads nor are mathemeticians limited to 3 dimensions of space. The limits of our
perception as denizens of 3D+time space make representaions of 4D space (and higher) incomplete at best. Our bodily senses may be trapped in 3D,
but this limitation also opens a door for artistic interpretation.

Below is a 1954 painting of the Crucifiction by Dal√≠ titled Corpus Hypercubus. The artist depicts one of the many ways a hypercube can be flattened
into 3 dimnesions which looks like some kind of 3D cubist cross. He called this blend of the scientific and the sacred, "Nuclear Mysticism."
